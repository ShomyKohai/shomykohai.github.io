Many times I find myself navigating through music streaming platforms in search of something to listen to while I do other stuff, such as playing around with Godot.
As a musician myself, when I find a song I find particularly good, I save it for later listening sessions.

## What are the factors I take into account when analyzing a song?
### Melody and drums
One of the first thing I notice in a song is surely the **drums** and the **lead melody**. Those two are what really make a song get stuck in your head.  


Something I really like is when the drums go hard, making the whole song instruments follow that rhythm.

One of the artists which music influenced me most regarding drums is [Iron T Hawk](https://twitter.com/ironthawk), with their album [ToT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU0XbGVV8E8).

### Harmony
Going further, I analyze the harmony of the song, trying to understand the chord progression and how each chord links to the others.  
This is really useful for me, because I can make use of the knowledge I gathered to make my own music.  
I listen to many genres of music, especially jazz, which comes with lots of complex chords compared to most of the music out there.  
Sometime I also analyze traditional music, like traditional japanese music.

### Lyrics
Music not only inspires me in composing, but also in writing stories.  
I'm always looking through many lyrics of many different songs.  
A song that really inspired me is [GATE OF STEINER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJtoh7ggGDE) from Steins;Gate for its conception of time.

## Some music I like

- [Iron T Hawk](https://www.youtube.com/@ironthawk)'s albums for their energetic and mysterious sounds.
- [PaperLily OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgeXLLAwNcs&list=PLDOjCqYj3ys3TEe8HCR7_cYH7X7dU28_B)
- Genshin Impact OST, as an inspiration for making ambience music.
